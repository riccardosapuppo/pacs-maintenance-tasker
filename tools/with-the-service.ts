/**
 * Start the service a check needs, and stop it again.
 *
 * A check that fetched a fixed address and hoped somebody had started something
 * has two failure modes, and the second is much worse: on a clean machine it
 * fails, so the publication gate cannot run it — and on a machine where
 * anything *is* listening there it passes, against whatever that is. A copy
 * left running from an hour ago, on an older commit, answers exactly like a
 * fresh one.
 *
 * So a check starts its own, on a port nothing else uses, and takes it away.
 * `--against <url>` points one at a running instance: a deliberate act, with a
 * flag on it, which is the whole difference.
